Running the App on Real iOS or Android Devices
In this course, we mainly run the app on virtual devices - the Android emulator or iOS simulator.

For development, using these virtual devices is great because changes are reflected almost instantly, you can use your real keyboard and benefit from many other convenience features.

But, of course, you should also test your app on some real devices at some point.

Therefore, the following articles provide step-by-step instructions on how to run your Flutter app on real Android or iOS devices (whilst developing it):

Run on Android (when working on Windows): https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows#set-up-your-android-device

Run on Android (when working on macOS): https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#set-up-your-android-device

Run on Android (when working on Linux): https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux#set-up-your-android-device

Run on iOS (macOS only): https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#deploy-to-ios-devices

Keep in mind that you can only build + run iOS apps when on a macOS device. Of course the code will be the same, no matter which platform you're using - but you can only build + run an iOS app from a Mac.

Flutter also supports other platforms - e.g, you can also build Windows or macOS desktop programs from your Flutter source code. However, this course focuses on building mobile apps for Android & iOS. Nonetheless, you can of course use the official documentation to also try running your app on those other platforms.
